# ChatBot-using-Tensorflow-and-Neural-Network
By means of this project, we have learnt how to create a Chatbot using TensorFlow. Using feedforward neural network, we were able to create a training algorithm which would take in input as a statement or question from user and would come up with an appropriate response on its own. The responses are selected by the algorithm from our JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file of responses.
